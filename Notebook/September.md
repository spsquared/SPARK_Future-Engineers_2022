We've recieved the email that we're competing in the internationals this year. We have some proposed changes to be made:
- Redesign camera mount to be higher up, making it easier to judge the location of walls
- Add LEDs to reduce the effects of uneven ambient lighting
- Change wall detection code to check the slope of the detected walls instead of assuming the locations based on the area of the image it's in
- Reduce thickness of rear wheels to prevent them from knocking over traffic signals we drive past

A new camera mount was designed; it used the four posts that the upper steering knuckle support uses rather than the holes for the body posts. There are indents in the forward screw holes on the bracket to allow for the new LED mounts.

Printing the new camera mount proved to be more difficult than expected. There was dust on the filament because we had left it sitting in a corner, making the extrusions messy and making half the print unusable. The printing speed may have been too fast, and the cooling fan couldn't cool the extruded material fast enough, resulting in warping and more messy spots. The messy edges of the print meant that the LED clips that fit over the mounting hardware doesn't fit.
On the positive side, the mounting holes lined up really well and the camera seems to be in a much better position with this bracket.

Also, there aren't any 1:12 scale 40mm wheels for our specific mounting pattern, so we ordered some tires off of amazon and began designing our own wheels.

Below is the final design for our custom wheel hub. It has a small diameter of 28mm to fit the [new wheels](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09YHC4NDS/).

The first print was "alright". The wheel fit onto the hub and the screw holes lined up. The hub is a bit too wide and is missing extra insets for the m3 bolt heads used to hold it onto the axle.
