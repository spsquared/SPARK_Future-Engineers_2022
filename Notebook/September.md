We've recieved the email that we're competing in the internationals this year. We have some proposed changes to be made:
- Redesign camera mount to be higher up, making it easier to judge the location of walls
- Add LEDs to reduce the effects of uneven ambient lighting
- Change wall detection code to check the slope of the detected walls instead of assuming the locations based on the area of the image it's in
