### Updates:
* CAD model for changes made - The Jetson NANO is now rotated 90 degrees to prevent the Arducam's ribbon cable from twisting
* Voltage regulators have been rotated to make soldering easier
* ESC has arrived

![Updated CAD model](./June/6-5-22-a.png)

### Changes to be made
* [XT 60 battery connectors](https://www.amazon.com/OOOUSE-XT60-Connector-Pairs-pairs/dp/B005FAPYXS) need to be purchased to match connectors on battery
* Special connectors for the servo and ESC have to be made (More to elaborate)

The servo requires a voltage input of 5-7.4V, and the ESC has an output of 6V on the wire to the "receiver". Since we are not using a receiver the 6V power and ground wires on the ESC connector must be removed,leaving a single pin for the PWM input. The servo should not be driven directly from the Jetson NANO since it will only take 5 volts and may draw a lot of current. There are two voltage regulators - one to power the Jetson NANO at 5V and the other can be used to power the servo at 7.4V. Therefore, the connections to the servo and ESC must be modified. The BEC in the ESC must be completely bypassed and the 7.4V input for the servo must be separated to the voltage regulator and the PWM pin for both have to go to the Jetson NANO.

Banana plugs will be soldered to the ESC's ABC connections, to make it removable. A 3-way splitter will be made by soldering 3 16 gauge wire together into one connector.

### Updates:
* Soldered ESC to motor and power
* Tested motor

The motor is too high kV, so it runs way too fast and does not seem to have maximum torque at low RPM. Switching out the motor for a lower kV motor will be better since having a finer range of speed and higher initial torque is better for this application.

Initial tests resulted in the motor starting at full speed and sending the wheels flying off - the clamps for the left wheel weren't tight enough. There's also silicone lubricant everywhere. A higher reduction probably would also help. Since we are using the smallest spur gear we can, we plan to buy a bigger differential gear and put in a smaller spur gear for lower speed and better torque.

### Updates:
* Changed positions for mounts
* Assembled/soldered parts on upper platform
* Designed mount for camera

The upper platform (platform, Jetson NANO, VRMs) has been soldered and assembled. There is a custom connector for the servo and ESC, with 7.4V running to the servo and their respective PWM pins running to pins 32 and 33 on the Jetson. The platform is mounted in the back where the body posts would be and the front on top of the servo bracket.

### Changes to parts

![Platform V3](./June/6-11-22-a.png)
#### Changes include:
* Standoff positions moved to allow easier wiring
* Ribs moved on top, now 3mm
* More cutouts on top for better wiring
* Expanded extra surface on top for more space

![Camera mount](./June/6-11-22-b.png)

#### Camera mount
* Features mounting holes for 1 camera configuration and mounting holes for a 2 camera configuration
* Mounts to the front of the car where the bumper would be
* Has holes for LED headlights if needed

# 6/17/22

### Updates:
* New 80-tooth diff gear arrived
* Larger wheels being designed
* 40mm fan arrived

The new 90-tooth diff gear arrived, and upon installing, it became apparent that it doesn't fit. Or rather, it barely fits and will get stuck at even the slightest tilt. We'll have to buy a new 84 tooth gear. We have some larger wheels in development to accomodate the new gear. These won't be foam tires and will have a tread, but it shouldn't affect handling.
