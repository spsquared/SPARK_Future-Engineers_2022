# How to Play

### Public Server

Mountain Guarder is available on a Repl!

<a href="https://mountainguarder.radioactivestuf.repl.co/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Public Server-%23000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=replit"></a>

### Hosting Your Own Server

There are multiple ways to run a Mountain Guarder server. You can host a server locally, or put it on a server hoster of your choice. As long as Node.js is supported, Mountain Guarder can run.

##### Setting Up the Server

To install a self-hosted local Mountain Guarder server:

1. Download  and install the LTS distribution of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) **checking the box "Automatically install necessary tools"**
2. [Download the source code](https://github.com/definitely-nobody-is-here/Mountain_Guarder/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) or [clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) into a folder you can remember the location of
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder you placed the game files in, then run `npm install` to download required dependencies

By default, the server will use a local file to store accounts. If you wish to use your own SQL database:

1. Open `config.json` and set "*useLocalDatabase*" to `false`
2. Create `url.js` in the folder "server"
3. Place "url = `<database uri here>`" inside `url.js` (replace `<data uri here>` with the uri of your SQL server)
4. Ensure your database is running while the server is running (or risk server crashes and data loss)

Mountain Guarder also has support for Replit databases. The server will automatically detect a Repl environment and attempt to use it.

*The priority list of databases is: external PostgreSQL (`env.DATABASE_URL`), Repl database (autodetect), local database (disabled with `useLocalDatabase` in `config.json`), local `url.js`.*

To start the server, use the same terminal from earlier to run `node app.js`. If the server ever stops, simply run that command again to start it again. To stop the server, type "stop" or press *Ctrl+C*.

##### Joining the Server

Once the server is started, you can find your computer's name (available in Windows>System>About as "Device name"), or simply search [what's my ip](http://google.com/search?q=whats+my+ip) or click the link. The server console will tell you what port to visit and you can type either the ip address or computer name on the client side **connected to the same network as the host** and then followed by a `:` and then the port number. Example: `111.22.33.444:2000` or `hostcomputer:1100`. The port will always be 4000.

### Gameplay

# Troubleshooting

This section troubleshoots basic issues with the server
.
#### There are errors

If you are getting errors or something seems broken (missing textures, stuff flying around all over your screen, tick timeouts) you can [submit a bug report](https://github.com/definitely-nobody-is-here/Mountain_Guarder/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug-report.md&title=BUG+-+%5BSummary+here%5D) including a screenshot of the problem and the most recent logs and any errors.

#### My Server Crashed

In the case that your server crashes, verify that there is a [PostgreSQL database](https://www.postgresql.org/) connected to your server, all dependencies are installed correctly, and that the server has an internet connection. If you are not using a [Discord Webhook](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) make sure `useDiscordWebhook` is `false` in `config.json`. If you have verified that the server has all necessary conditions to run and the server still crashed, [submit a bug report](https://github.com/definitely-nobody-is-here/Mountain_Guarder/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug-report.md&title=BUG+-+%5BSummary+here%5D) including a screenshot of the most recent logs and any error messages on the client or server.

#### I can't Connect to the Server (ERROR_Connection_Refused)

If you can't connect to the server and are running it locally without a hosting service, verify that:
 - The server is running
 - You have entered the correct port number and hostname
 - You are connected to the same WiFi network as the server
If you have verified all four of the above, try restarting the server. If your server is running on a hosting service (like Heroku) check that your link is correct.

#### The Server is Slow

There is nothing we can do about this. It could be your connection speed or a slow server unable to run the game at full speed. Press "backslash" (`\`) ingame and in the top-right corner it should list TPS and Ping. If your Ping is high then that is likely the source of your lag. If you TPS is low then the server is lagging. Check that there is nothing eating your computer's resources by opening Task Manager (Windows) by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Esc.

If you can't resolve your problem after trying these solutions or your problem is not on this page, go to the [Issues](https://github.com/definitely-nobody-is-here/Mountain_Guarder/issues) page and [submit a bug report](https://github.com/definitely-nobody-is-here/Mountain_Guarder/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug-report.md&title=BUG+-+%5BSummary+here%5D) and fill out as much information as possible.

## Want to Contribute?

To report a bug, you can submit a [submit a bug report](https://github.com/definitely-nobody-is-here/Mountain_Guarder/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug-report.md&title=BUG+-+%5BSummary+here%5D) by filling out the template. Please provide as much information to the template as possible.

If you would like to contribute code to this game, visit the [Github](https://github.com/definitely-nobody-is-here/Mountain_Guarder) where you can send a pull request with an application request stating your reason to create a pull request in the "comments" section along with it.

If you would like to submit a suggestion you can also visit the [Github](https://github.com/definitely-nobody-is-here/Mountain_Guarder) and create a [suggestion](https://github.com/definitely-nobody-is-here/Mountain_Guarder/issues/new?assignees=&labels=suggestion&template=feature_request.md&title=SUGGESTION+-+%5BSummary+here%5D).

The public server database is NOT available to the public. By default, Mountain Guarder servers will use a local database. See [SECURITY.md](/SECURITY.md) for more information.

Please don't ask to convert all the code to ES2015 as that's too large of a change to be viable for a single update. The current system works fine, even if that means that there are some strange workarounds in the code.
