# Security Policy

## Database URL

The database URI will not be disclosed. Any release of database credentials to the public will allow modification, deletetion, and injection of user accounts. Don't ask for it, you can use your own local database or set up your own SQL database.

## Supported Versions

Supported versions are stable versions free of critical security issues that can run without breaking the format of accounts created on the most recent version. Run unsupported versions at your own risk. ("risk" meaning a near-guaranteed inventory loss and possible crashes) An old version may still run, but cannot load accounts created in later versions.
